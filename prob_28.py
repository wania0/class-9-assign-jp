# Booking System
# Design a booking system where users specify a start datetime, end datetime, and timezone. Implement a function that checks whether a specified time slot is available.
# if timeslot is available then store the start_date and end_date in the list of objects i.e
"""
booking_storage = [
  {
    "start_date": "",
    "end_date": ""
  }
]
"""
# hint 1: store dates in booking_storage in UTC format i.e pytz.utc
# hint 2: use for loop, the loop should run 5 times. ask user input inside the loop

# instruction to test your program:
# first iteration of loop
# give input "2023-08-26 18:00:00" as start_date and "2023-08-26 19:00:00" as end_date and "Asia/Karachi" as timezone

# second iteration of loop
# give input "2023-08-26 16:00:00" as start_date and "2023-08-26 17:00:00" as end_date and "Asia/Riyadh" as timezone
# above program should not accept this booking as the slot is already booked by the first iteration

# Solution :

from datetime import datetime, date
import pytz


booking_storage = [
    {
        
    }
]
